# SQL

This repository contains my completed hands-on projects from the Advanced MySQL Data Analysis course (LinkedIn Learning, by John Pauler & Maven Analytics).
The course focuses on using SQL for advanced analytics with real-world e-commerce data — covering complex joins, window functions, and data-driven business insights.

Example of business problems solved in practical tasks:

Customer Retention & Cohorts – Identified repeat buyers, measured retention rates, and tracked lifecycle trends.

Conversion Funnel Analysis – Calculated drop-off and conversion rates across key stages of the purchase journey.

Channel Performance Optimization – Evaluated traffic sources (email, search, referral) by revenue contribution and ROI.

Product Profitability Insights – Ranked products by sales volume, margin, and contribution to total revenue.

User Segmentation – Classified users by activity level (new, active, churned) to support targeted engagement strategies.

Seasonality & Trend Detection – Measured monthly and weekly performance to uncover seasonal demand patterns.

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) – Estimated LTV to assess long-term profitability by cohort and acquisition source.
